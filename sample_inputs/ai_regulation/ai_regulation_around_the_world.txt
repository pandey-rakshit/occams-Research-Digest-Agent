5 Best Practices to Adhere AI Regulations
The Importance of Regulating AI Technologies 
Artificial intelligence poses a range of real-world concerns that make regulation both necessary and challenging. These issues span from immediate technical risks to broader societal and existential implications:

Privacy: AI systems are often integrated with personal data and digital behavior. Governments like those in the EU are responding with legislation that prohibits high-risk AI applications such as real-time biometric surveillance and social scoring, reflecting public anxiety over surveillance and data misuse. China mandates pre-approval of algorithms and enforces alignment with state ideologies, highlighting the geopolitical dimension of AI governance.
Safety and accountability: High-risk systems, such as those used in autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and public infrastructure, require pre-market testing, documentation, and human oversight under the EU’s AI Act. These measures aim to ensure that AI behaves reliably and transparently in critical areas. In the U.S., although there is no national law yet, agencies are stepping in to address AI risks in domains like finance, healthcare, and child safety.
Existential risk: Leading AI scientists such as Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio have warned about the potential for AI to become uncontrollable, posing risks on par with nuclear war or pandemics. Their concerns have led to global calls for prioritizing the mitigation of such risks.
Economic concerns: AI’s impact on jobs and workforce dynamics has also become a central issue. While proponents argue that AI can drive productivity and innovation, critics worry about widespread job displacement and unequal benefits. Policymakers must balance the need to foster innovation with protecting workers.
Geopolitical and trade tensions: The EU’s laws will apply to non-EU providers, exporting its regulatory standards. Meanwhile, the U.S. is likely to continue a fragmented approach, which could lead to inconsistencies but also allow more flexibility for innovation. These diverging strategies may lead to trade friction, particularly between democratic nations and authoritarian regimes like China.

Key Components of AI Regulations 
Various regulations affecting the development of and use of AI focus on the same set of objectives.

Privacy and Data Protection
Privacy and data protection are central to AI regulations, mandating that AI applications comply with legal standards regarding personal data use. Regulations require systems to respect user privacy, ensuring secure handling, storage, and processing of personal information. Effective privacy measures build public trust in AI technologies by protecting individuals' rights to data protection.

Compliance with privacy regulations requires AI systems to integrate robust data security protocols and transparent data management practices. These measures ensure that data is only used for intended purposes and protects against unauthorized access.

Safety and Security
Safety and security components of AI regulations address potential threats posed by AI technologies to individuals and society. Regulations set standards to ensure AI applications operate safely, mitigating risks such as unintended harm or malicious misuse. Security measures protect AI systems against vulnerabilities and cyber threats that could compromise their integrity and functionality.

Implementing safety standards involves adhering to best practices in system design, testing, and monitoring. Regular assessments and updates to security protocols are imperative to maintain safe AI operations. By emphasizing safety and security, AI regulations aim to protect public health, safety, and welfare.

Transparency and Explainability
Transparency and explainability in AI help stakeholders understand how AI systems make decisions. These components ensure that AI processes are not opaque, increasing trust among users and stakeholders. Regulators aim to implement measures requiring AI systems to disclose their functionality, enabling users to understand the system's decision pathways and the data influencing these decisions.

Explainability also involves simplifying complex AI algorithms to make them comprehensible. By demystifying AI operations, stakeholders, including non-experts, can gain insights into system behavior. 

Accountability and Responsibility
AI regulations emphasize accountability, ensuring those who develop and deploy AI systems are responsible for their impacts. Organizations must take ownership of the AI systems they produce, establish clear guidelines for accountability, and set mechanisms to assess performance and rectify issues. This ensures developers and companies remain answerable for the actions and decisions of AI systems.

Responsibility extends to the appropriate use of AI applications, requiring stakeholders to align AI deployment with safety standards. By enforcing accountability measures, AI regulations prevent negligence and promote responsible use of AI technologies.

AI Regulations Around the World 
1. European Union (EU): AI Act
In brief: What this regulation mandates

Security: The Act mandates that high-risk AI systems meet standards for robustness, accuracy, and cybersecurity. Providers must conduct risk assessments and implement human oversight to ensure system integrity.
Privacy: The AI Act complements the GDPR by enforcing transparency obligations, such as informing users when interacting with AI systems like chatbots or encountering AI-generated content.
‍

Regulation in-depth

The AI Act is the European Union's legal framework for regulating artificial intelligence. Adopted in 2024, it aims to promote the development of trustworthy AI while protecting fundamental rights and public safety. It introduces a risk-based approach that categorizes AI systems into four risk levels: 

Unacceptable-risk AI systems are banned entirely. These include AI applications that manipulate users, exploit vulnerabilities, or enable mass biometric surveillance. The legislation prohibits practices like real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces and emotion recognition in schools and workplaces.
High-risk AI systems—such as those used in critical infrastructure, education, employment, and law enforcement—are subject to strict compliance requirements. Providers must conduct risk assessments, ensure high-quality datasets, maintain detailed documentation, and implement human oversight. These systems must also meet standards for robustness, accuracy, and cybersecurity.
Limited-risk AI systems face transparency obligations. For example, users must be informed when interacting with AI systems like chatbots or when encountering AI-generated content, especially deepfakes or media intended to inform the public.
Minimal or no-risk AI—which includes most consumer applications like spam filters or video games—is not subject to regulation under the Act.
The Act also introduces rules for general-purpose AI models, particularly those that could pose systemic risks. Providers of such models must implement risk mitigation measures and comply with transparency and copyright standards. These rules will come into effect in August 2025 and will be supported by a forthcoming Code of Practice.

Privacy: While the framework builds on existing roles of sectoral regulators, it does not introduce sweeping AI-specific legislation, relying instead on context-based oversight to address privacy concerns.
Regulation in-depth

The UK’s approach to AI regulation, outlined in the 2023 white paper A Pro-Innovation Approach to AI Regulation, emphasizes flexibility, sector-specific oversight, and a commitment to responsible innovation. Rather than introducing sweeping AI-specific legislation or a central AI regulator, the UK has opted for a context-based framework that builds on the existing roles and expertise of sectoral regulators. This strategy aims to avoid stifling innovation.

The framework includes five cross-sectoral principles: 

Safety, security and robustness
Appropriate transparency and explainability
Accountability and governance
Contestability and redress
These principles serve as guidelines for regulators to interpret and apply within their respective domains. Initially non-statutory, the government is considering whether to formalize a statutory duty for regulators to “have due regard” to these principles after an implementation period​.

The framework includes new central functions within government to coordinate regulatory activity and support implementation. This includes publishing guidance, enabling regulator capability-building, and conducting cross-sector risk assessments. The UK also established a steering committee and launched an AI and Digital Hub to provide innovators with regulatory advice​.

AI International Initiatives 
There are also some regulations that aim to unify AI standards across borders.

OECD AI Principles
The OECD’s Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence—adopted in 2019 and updated in 2023 and 2024—is the first intergovernmental standard promoting trustworthy AI. It establishes five principles for responsible AI development and five recommendations for national and international action. These principles aim to ensure AI systems are human-centric, trustworthy, and aligned with democratic values and human rights.

Principles for Trustworthy AI

Inclusive growth, sustainable development, and well-being: AI should benefit people and the planet by improving human capabilities, promoting inclusion, reducing inequality, and supporting environmental sustainability.
Respect for the rule of law, human rights, and democratic values: AI actors must uphold freedoms, dignity, equality, and rights throughout the AI lifecycle. Mechanisms should protect against misuse and ensure human oversight.
Transparency and explainability: Stakeholders should understand how AI systems operate. Providers must disclose information about data sources, logic, and decision-making processes in a clear and context-appropriate way, enabling users to challenge outputs where needed.
Robustness, security, and safety: AI systems should function reliably in various conditions and be designed to prevent and mitigate harm. Systems must be overrideable or decommissioned when needed and support information integrity.
Accountability: AI actors are responsible for ensuring systems function correctly and in line with these principles. They must enable traceability of data and decisions, apply risk management at all lifecycle stages, and collaborate with other stakeholders to address issues like bias and rights violations.
National and International Recommendations

Invest in research and development: Governments should fund long-term AI R&D, promote open science, and support tools and datasets that are representative and privacy-compliant.
Foster an inclusive AI ecosystem: Promote access to digital infrastructure, AI technologies, and shared knowledge through legal and secure data-sharing mechanisms such as data trusts.
Create an interoperable governance environment: Support agile, outcome-based policies, regulatory sandboxes, and cross-border cooperation to align governance frameworks and stimulate responsible innovation.
Build human capacity and prepare for labour market changes: Equip citizens with AI-related skills, ensure smooth transitions for displaced workers, and promote quality employment through dialogue and training.
Advance international cooperation: Collaborate globally to develop shared AI standards, foster knowledge exchange, and create indicators to measure AI development and policy effectiveness.
The OECD AI Principles have become a global benchmark, informing AI policies in the G20 and many member and non-member countries. Their focus on flexibility and adaptability ensures continued relevance as AI technologies evolve, especially with the emergence of generative AI.

Council of Europe Framework Convention on AI
The Council of Europe Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law is the world’s first legally binding international treaty on AI. Opened for signature on September 5, 2024, the convention sets out legal obligations to ensure that the lifecycle of AI systems respects fundamental rights while promoting innovation.

Scope and Purpose

The treaty applies to both public and private actors using AI systems, including private entities acting on behalf of public authorities. It aims to close regulatory gaps in existing human rights frameworks as AI technologies evolve, without regulating specific technologies, maintaining a technology-neutral stance.

Core Requirements

States that ratify the convention must embed several fundamental principles into the design, development, and deployment of AI systems:

Human autonomy
Privacy and data protection
Transparency and oversight
Accountability and responsibility
Reliability
Safe innovation
The convention also guarantees remedies and procedural safeguards. Affected individuals must have access to sufficient information about AI system usage to understand and challenge decisions. They must also be informed when interacting with an AI system and be able to file complaints with competent authorities.

Risk and Impact Management

Parties are required to conduct iterative risk and impact assessments on AI’s implications for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. These assessments must lead to appropriate mitigation measures, and in some cases, governments may impose bans or moratoria on harmful AI applications.

Compliance Options for the Private Sector

Countries can choose one of two compliance approaches for private sector activities:

Apply the convention’s provisions directly, or
Implement alternative but equivalent measures in line with international human rights obligations.
Monitoring and Enforcement

Implementation is overseen by the Conference of the Parties, a body composed of state representatives. This group reviews compliance, issues recommendations, and coordinates with stakeholders through activities such as public hearings.

By focusing on binding commitments and inclusive oversight, the Framework Convention seeks to ensure that AI systems operate within the bounds of democratic values and fundamental rights across all member states and signatories.

5 Best Practices to Adhere AI Regulations
The following best practices can help organizations ensure their AI systems and usage policies align with AI regulations around the world.

1. Establish Clear AI Governance Policies
Organizations should begin by building a formal governance structure that oversees the development, deployment, and maintenance of AI systems. This includes defining accountability across teams, appointing responsible officers, and setting up cross-functional collaboration among legal, technical, and operational departments.

Governance policies must outline roles and responsibilities, review and approval workflows, and escalation paths for security concerns or compliance issues. Additionally, organizations should create frameworks for documenting AI system purposes, intended use cases, risk classification, and lifecycle activities. These policies ensure that all AI initiatives are guided by consistent principles aligned with regulatory expectations and organizational values.

2. Implement Continuous Compliance Solutions
AI systems evolve over time due to updates in models, data, or operating environments. Compliance solutions must be designed to detect changes and flag regulatory risks as they arise. This requires embedding compliance checks into the AI development pipeline—from data ingestion to model deployment and post-production monitoring.

Tools like automated documentation generators, model validation platforms, and compliance dashboards help track whether systems meet transparency and data protection standards. These systems should be able to trigger alerts or policy enforcement actions when deviations occur.

3. Implement Thorough Data Management Practices
Data quality and governance are foundational to regulatory compliance. Organizations must establish policies for sourcing data legally, ensuring consent where applicable, and documenting data provenance. This includes verifying the accuracy, completeness, and diversity of AI training data to prevent biased outcomes.

Strong AI data management involves versioning training datasets, labeling data with appropriate metadata, and maintaining logs of data access and transformations in AI workflows. Privacy-by-design approaches should be integrated into AI models and their data pipelines, including pseudonymization, minimization, and differential privacy when necessary. These controls help demonstrate compliance with data protection laws such as GDPR, PIPL, or CCPA and support reliable model performance.

4. Monitor and Audit AI Systems Continuously
Ongoing monitoring ensures AI systems behave as intended and stay within compliance thresholds. This includes tracking metrics like accuracy, false positive/negative rates, and system availability. Monitoring should also cover input data shifts and unexpected outputs that may indicate model drift or failures.

Auditing processes should be periodic and event-driven, covering both technical performance and regulatory criteria. Maintaining logs of predictions, decision rationale, and model updates is critical for traceability. Organizations should establish procedures for incident response and corrective action based on audit findings. These practices provide evidence of due diligence and help identify issues before they escalate into compliance violations.

5. Provide Ongoing Training and Awareness
AI regulation is complex and constantly evolving. Organizations must equip employees with the knowledge and skills to navigate this landscape effectively. Regular training sessions should cover the latest legal frameworks, safety principles, and organizational compliance protocols.

Programs should be tailored to different roles—for example, engineers might need deep dives on model transparency and accuracy , while product managers may focus on consent and data governance. Interactive workshops, simulation exercises, and role-specific guidance help reinforce understanding.
